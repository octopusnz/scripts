0. Why does this exist?
--------------------------

The script is designed to provide a snapshot of projects in progress on a developers
local machine. It will complete some simple checks on header files included to make
sure they are accesible either via compiler include paths or in the local project
directories.

1. Requirements
-----------------------------------

- Bash 4.3+
- Projects that utilise a Makefile or similar containing a compiler definition
- Languages that utilise either GCC and/or Clang compilers
- find and grep


2. Configuration
-----------------------------------

The following variables at the top of the script are configurable:

compiler_string: String to search for in the project file that defines the compiler.
file_ext:        File extension to search for in the project folders.
lock_file:       Name of the lock file.
lock_file_dir:   Directory lock file will be created in
project_file:    The name of the project file that will be searched for the
                 compiler string. Is case-insensitive.


3. Exit codes and troubleshooting
-----------------------------------

The following exit codes are specified.
This is based on: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html

Exit 0 - Success.
Exit 1 - Reserved for system.
Exit 2 - Reserved for system.
